Compile:
g++ hello.cpp -o hello

A compiler translates the C++ program into machine language code which it stores on the disk as a file with the extension .o (e.g. hello.o). A linker then links the object code with standard library routines that the program may use and creates an executable image which is also saved on disk, usually as a file with the file name without any extension (e.g. hello).

Execute:
./hello

The executable is loaded from the disk to memory and the computerâ€™s CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program one instruction at a time.
